# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch-Without-Libraries

Tools used: Python, Latex (for writing Maths equations), Numpy, Matplotlib

The notebooks in this repo will all be written without machine learning libraries. The main objective of this repo is to establish inference understanding. 

Therefore, the datasets will be quite simple as the focus is on the Maths and Process behind each Algorithm.

Every file will be clearly written with the process documented, have a look!
